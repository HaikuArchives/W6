I agree with that, I think I'll implement a full screen mode in which the status window will be attached as you required.

Yes I think this would be a good idea. It makes thinking about strategy a bit harder if you spend your time buying things while things happen all around. I'll add it to my list. Maybe I'll set this as an option so that people can still use the real-time mode.
