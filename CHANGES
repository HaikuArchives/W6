V1.7:
- Interface change, now there are icons, and progress bars for percentages
- The power percentage bar was moved below the map
- The Info window is separate from the rest and the power bar was moved
- Added BubbleHelp thanks to Marco Nelissen's source
- Added ability to zoom inside the map (still quite buggy, you really shouldn't use it :-)
- Game calculation doesn't stop  while dragging with the mouse...
- W6 won't crash anymore if flags or title pic are missing.
- Optimized "multiply routine" to speed up display when country conquered
- Several optimizations in display routines.
- And so many little bugs....
- Speed up settings don't make the game as unplayable as it did...
- Added sound support (but only startup sounds exists for the only running scenario)

V1.5:
- Removed bug when finding distance on non-existent country crashed.
- Removed setting screen back to wrong resolution when exiting.
- Changed Infantry from int to long (did not allow sending millions of men).
- Removed bug in buy window which didn't let your buy airforce unless you had ten times the money.
- First window (for choosing party) is no longer resizable
- Removed bug that made sea and border act as countries of pacific group
- Added group_military_power bar
- Population should be displaying OK in China
- Removed bug that didn't bring conquered groups to their occupants
- An agressor that is too weak gets captured (less than 5x the strength)
- Now countries have secondary ennemies, for example when Fascism, Kingdoms and Theocracies are over, democracy will fight communism
-Removed Bug when hitting return instead of clicking send/buy buttons caused the game to crash
- Windows now scroll to the right limit and not further
- Help menu can now open documentation in Netpositive directly (thx Marc)
- Now maps get only updated on the appropriate region, really much faster.
- Added lots of features in the EDITOR WINDOW, still unable to save however
- Right mouse button now, drags the map view instead of selecting an unexisting country and beeping ;-)
- Added Retreat
- Not changing resolutions anymore, windows are cool... and safe ;-).
- Interface is kind of scalable (info-view on the left)
- When a country is conquered and is one of its victim's first agressor, then the troops retreat (they're captured by the conquerer). Watch your back!
- The higher the repression level your politic has, the higher is the risk of revolution in case of low moral
- Strength of the resistance attacks depends on propaganda of original group's politic
- Game ends when different groups with a unique politic rule the world.
- Selected country's flags changes immediately if it's been conquered by another group.
- Separated some things into different threads. Now overall more responsive.
- Removed those ugly scrollbars. Now map-scrolling is done via the right mouse button.
- Added some shortcuts (see documentation).
- Added personalized cursors.
- Removed bug that caused the editor to crash when updating if no group or politic was selected.
- If a country can't attack anyone but can buy its minimum defense troops, it will send part of its army to the weakest country in its group.
- And of course, switch to the ELF format. This program will now require BeOS R4 at least (on Intel). The new compiler found 497 (!) errors and 
warnings... thanks, Mr. GNU for having reminded me some rules.
